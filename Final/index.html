            If I should have a daughter, instead of mom, she’s going to call me Point B,

            because that way she knows that no matter what happens,
            at least she can always find her way to me.

            And I am going to paint the Solar Systems on the backs of her hands,
            so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say ‘Oh, I know that like the back of my hand’

            And she’s going to learn that this life will hit you,
            <br>hard,
            <br>in the face,
            <br>wait for you to get back up, just so it can kick you in the stomach
            but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air.

            There is hurt, fear that cannot be fixed by band aids or poetry
            so the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn’t coming
            I’ll make sure she knows she does not have to wear the cape all by herself
            because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers,
            your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal.

            And baby, I’ll tell her, don’t keep your nose up in the air like that
            I know that trick, I’ve done it a million times
            You’re just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail
            back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire
            to see if you can save him.
